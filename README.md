# NASA Sattelite Prediction Using Earth Assets API
Description of the assignment:
Uses NASA's public HTTP APIs to create a function that predicts the next time a satellite image will be taken of a specific location. This feature is useful for those trying to get their picture onto online mapping applications like Google Maps. The implementation can be done in any language, with the requirement that the code is production quality, well-designed, and easy to read.
